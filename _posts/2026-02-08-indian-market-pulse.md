## Market Sentiment
The Indian market is expected to open on a cautious note today, with investors awaiting the release of key economic data. The overall sentiment remains bullish, with the Nifty hovering around the **18,500** mark. However, the market may witness some profit-booking at higher levels, which could lead to a correction.

## Global Cues
Global markets are trading mixed, with the US markets witnessing a decline in the previous session. The Asian markets are trading higher, with the Nikkei and Hang Seng indices up by **0.5%** and **0.8%**, respectively. The global cues are likely to have a limited impact on the Indian market today.

## Strategy
For today's session, we recommend a buy-on-dips strategy for the Nifty, with a target of **18,800** and a stop-loss at **18,200**. For the BankNifty, we recommend a buy-on-dips strategy, with a target of **42,000** and a stop-loss at **40,500**. Investors are advised to keep a close eye on the **18,500** level for the Nifty and the **41,000** level for the BankNifty, as a breach of these levels could lead to a significant move.
