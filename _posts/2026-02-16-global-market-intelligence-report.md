### Introduction to 1Q 2026 Market Trends

The first quarter of 2026 has begun with significant volatility in global markets, primarily driven by a tech sell-off and concerns over the Chinese economy. According to recent reports from Goldman Sachs Asset Management and The Guardian, these factors have led to a struggle in global markets. Additionally, the US tech stocks falling by 3% has sparked an Asian market selloff, as highlighted by IG Group's Market Navigator. This report aims to analyze the current state of the NASDAQ, FTSE 100, and China markets, providing insights for traders and investors.

## Analysis of Key Markets

### NASDAQ
The NASDAQ, heavily influenced by the tech sector, has experienced fluctuations due to the sell-off. Despite this, the S&P 500 has reached new highs, as reported by Fortune, indicating resilience in the US market. The mid-year market outlook for 2025 by J.P. Morgan suggested a broad spectrum of potential outcomes, which still holds relevance in 2026. The performance of the NASDAQ will be crucial in determining the direction of global markets.

### FTSE 100
The FTSE 100, a key indicator of the UK's economic health, has seen significant movements. According to FOREX.com's FTSE 100 forecast for February 16, 2026, the index is expected to continue its trend based on global economic indicators. The biggest UK stock market gainers, such as 1Spatial and Fresnillo, have shown substantial growth, as reported by TechStock². These movements suggest that despite global uncertainties, specific sectors within the UK market are performing well.

### China Markets
The Chinese economy, a significant player in global trade, faces uncertainty due to various factors, including tariffs and economic restructuring. The Global Indices in Focus report by substack.com highlights the performance, Sharpe ratios, concentration, and diversification of global indices from 2015 to 2025, which includes insights into China's market performance.
