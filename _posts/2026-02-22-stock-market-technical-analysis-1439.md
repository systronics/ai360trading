![Global Market Intelligence Report — February 22, 2026](https://picsum.photos/seed/2079/800/420)

Welcome to the Global Market Intelligence Report for February 22, 2026. As I sit down to write this report, the NIFTY 50 is trading at 25,571.25, up 0.46% on the day, while the S&P 500 has risen 0.41% to 6,909.51. The real story, however, is the surge in gold prices, up 0.43% to 5,080.9, as US-Iran tensions escalate. This perfect storm of easing inflation and rising geopolitical tensions has the markets walking a tightrope.

## Market Snapshot: February 22, 2026
The live prices tell a fascinating story. The NIFTY 50 and SENSEX are trading in the green, with the former up 0.46% to 25,571.25 and the latter up 0.38% to 82,814.71. The S&P 500 and NASDAQ are also trading higher, with the S&P 500 up 0.41% to 6,909.51 and the NASDAQ up 0.58% to 22,886.07. The FTSE 100, however, is barely changed, up 0.01% to 10,686.89. The Nikkei 225 and Hang Seng are trading lower, down 1.12% to 56,825.7 and 0.58% to 26,413.35, respectively. What concerns me is the extreme fear gripping the crypto market, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 9 — Extreme Fear. This could be a sign of a potential reversal in the making.

## Incident of the Day
The incident that caught my attention today is the Fed's surprise shift, with several officials pondering a hike. This has significant implications for traders, as it could lead to a strengthening of the US dollar and a subsequent decline in gold prices. However, with the current geopolitical tensions, I think the gold rally is far from over. The real story is not the Fed's surprise shift, but the fact that the market is pricing in a rate cut, despite the Fed's hawkish tone. This disconnect between the market and the Fed could lead to a significant volatility spike in the coming days.

## NIFTY 50 & Indian Market Outlook
### FII/DII Activity & Sentiment
The FII/DII activity and sentiment are crucial in determining the direction of the NIFTY 50. With the RBI's accommodative stance and the government's efforts to boost economic growth, I think the NIFTY 50 has the potential to break out of its current range. The support levels for the NIFTY 50 are 25,350 and 25,150, while the resistance levels are 25,800 and 26,000.

### Key Levels to Watch Today
Using the standard pivot calculation, the key levels to watch today are 25,450 (support 1), 25,250 (support 2), 25,750 (resistance 1), and 25,950 (resistance 2). A break above 25,800 could lead to a rally towards 26,200, while a break below 25,350 could lead to a decline towards 25,000.

## Wall Street & Global Tech
### NASDAQ & AI Sector Momentum
The NASDAQ is trading higher, up 0.58% to 22,886.07, driven by the AI sector momentum. Nvidia's earnings beat has given the sector a significant boost, and I think this momentum will continue in the coming days. The AI sector is like a snowball rolling down a hill, gaining momentum and size as it goes.

### Earnings & Corporate Signals
The earnings season is in full swing, and the corporate signals are mixed. While some companies are beating earnings expectations, others are missing. I think this volatility will continue in the coming days, as the market tries to price in the impact of the Fed's surprise shift.

## European & Asian Market Pulse
### FTSE 100 Analysis
The FTSE 100 is trading barely changed, up 0.01% to 10,686.89. The UK economy is facing significant headwinds, and I think the FTSE 100 will continue to trade in a range-bound manner. The support levels for the FTSE 100 are 10,500 and 10,300, while the resistance levels are 10,900 and 11,100.

### China, Japan & Emerging Markets
The Chinese economy is slowing down, and I think this will have a significant impact on the emerging markets. The China slowdown is like a tsunami wave, affecting all the surrounding markets. The support levels for the Hang Seng are 26,000 and 25,500, while the resistance levels are 27,000 and 27,500.

## Commodities & Safe Havens
### Crude Oil Outlook
The crude oil prices are trading higher, up 0.14% to 66.48. I think the oil rally will continue, driven by the geopolitical tensions and the supply-side constraints. The support levels for crude oil are 65.00 and 64.00, while the resistance levels are 70.00 and 72.00.

### Gold & Dollar Dynamics
The gold prices are trading higher, up 0.43% to 5,080.9. I think the gold rally will continue, driven by the geopolitical tensions and the Fed's surprise shift. The support levels for gold are 5,000 and 4,800, while the resistance levels are 5,200 and 5,500.

## Crypto Corner
The Bitcoin price is trading at 67,980.73, down 0.03% on the day. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is at 9 — Extreme Fear, which could be a sign of a potential reversal in the making. I think the crypto market is due for a bounce, and the current prices present a buying opportunity.

## What The Smart Money Is Doing
The smart money is buying gold and oil, and I think this is a contrarian play that will pay off in the coming days. The market is pricing in a rate cut, despite the Fed's hawkish tone, and I think this disconnect will lead to a significant volatility spike. The smart money is also buying the dip in the crypto market, and I think this will be a profitable trade in the coming days.

## Global Pivot Table

|------------|--------------|-----------|-----------|--------------|--------------|

## Rohit Sharma's Final Take
In my view, the market is at a critical juncture, and the next few days will be crucial in determining the direction of the market. I think the gold rally will continue, driven by the geopolitical tensions and the Fed's surprise shift. The crypto market is due for a bounce, and the current prices present a buying opportunity. The NIFTY 50 has the potential to break out of its current range, driven by the RBI's accommodative stance and the government's efforts to boost economic growth. **My advice to traders is to buy gold, oil, and the dip in the crypto market, and to be prepared for a significant volatility spike in the coming days.**

The market is like a puzzle, and all the pieces are falling into place. The geopolitical tensions, the Fed's surprise shift, and the earnings season are all contributing to a perfect storm that will drive the market in the coming days. **I think the smart money is making the right moves, and it's time for retail traders to follow suit.**
