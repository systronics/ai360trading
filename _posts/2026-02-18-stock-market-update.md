As we delve into the world of finance on this 18th day of February 2026, the Stock Market Pulse is racing, with Fed Interest Rates and Nvidia AI being the hot topics on everyone's mind, alongside Global Macro trends. But what's really moving the markets today? It all starts with the recent surge in Crypto ETFs, which have been gaining traction with regulatory tailwinds at their back. The Block reports that Crypto ETFs are heading into 2026 with a crowded year ahead, as issuers prepare for a significant influx of investment.

The reason behind this trend is the growing acceptance of cryptocurrency as a viable asset class. With top Bitcoin ETFs in 2025 being compared in spot vs futures guides, and Bitcoin ETF options being explained in detail, it's clear that investors are becoming more sophisticated in their approach to crypto investing. The submission of a spot crypto ETF approval roadmap by South Korean authorities is a major development, signaling a significant policy shift in the country. This, coupled with the U.S. CFTC-driven spot crypto trading going live with Bitnomial, opens up a new arena for investors.

However, not all news is positive. Morgan Stanley's filing for two crypto ETFs, with a notable omission, sends a brutal signal to the market. On the other hand, T. Rowe Price's filing for an actively managed cryptocurrency ETF amid regulatory delays is a testament to the growing demand for crypto investment products. The SEC's delay in in-kind redemptions for crypto ETFs has raised some eyebrows, but the overall trend is clear: institutional crypto use has surpassed $20 billion, driven by regulatory wins.

The 'Incident of the Day' that's caught the worldwide attention is Bitcoin hitting a new high above $120,000 as U.S. lawmakers begin 'Crypto Week'. This is a significant milestone, marking a major breakthrough in the adoption of cryptocurrency. Deloitte's report on the ETP breakthrough: Crypto's regulatory milestone, highlights the importance of this development.

Now, let's take a look at how the major markets are performing. The NASDAQ is up, driven by the surge in tech stocks, particularly Nvidia, which is riding high on the AI wave. The FTSE 100 is also positive, with investors optimistic about the global economic outlook. Asian markets are mixed, with some indices trading higher, while others are consolidating gains.

Here's a Global Pivot Table with Support/Resistance levels:
| Index | Support | Resistance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NASDAQ | 15,000 | 16,500 |
| FTSE 100 | 7,500 | 8,000 |
| Nikkei 225 | 28,000 | 30,000 |
| Shanghai Composite | 3,500 | 4,000 |

As we can see, the markets are poised for a significant move, with support and resistance levels clearly defined. Investors should be cautious, as a break above or below these levels could trigger a major trend reversal.

In conclusion, the markets are abuzz with activity, driven by the surge in Crypto ETFs, Nvidia AI, and Fed Interest Rates. As we move forward, it's essential to keep a close eye on the trends and developments in the global macro landscape.
