## 🌎 Global Market Sentiment: Neutral-Bullish

The global landscape is showing a fascinating split as we head into the new trading week. While the **US Tech Sector (Nasdaq 100)** is consolidating near record highs, emerging markets are seeing renewed institutional interest.

### 1. Wall Street Oversight
US futures remained steady over the weekend. Our AI models suggest that the **NVIDIA-led AI rally** is entering a 'healthy' consolidation phase. 
* **Key Level:** Support at 17,450. A break below this could trigger a short-term correction in global tech stocks.

### 2. The Indian Angle: GIFT Nifty
The **GIFT Nifty** is currently indicating a slightly positive start for the Indian indices. Traders should watch the first 15 minutes of the NSE open closely to see if the gap-up holds.
* **Intraday Bias:** Bullish above 22,200.
* **Risk:** Increasing DXY (Dollar Index) might pressure the Rupee.

### 3. Commodities: Gold’s Stealth Rally
Gold is continuing its climb as a hedge against global uncertainty. With central banks across Asia increasing their reserves, the $2,100 level has become a strong floor.
