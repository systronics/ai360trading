## Market Snapshot — March 01, 2026
A bearish engulfing pattern is forming on the NIFTY 50 chart, with the index currently trading at 25,178.65, down 1.25% from the previous close. The India VIX has surged 4.9% to 13.7, indicating increased volatility in the market. Meanwhile, the NASDAQ has fallen 2.09% to 22,668.21, and Silver has surged 7.23% to 93.29. The top trending topic in the market today is the impact of the US-Iran conflict on global oil prices. With the NIFTY 50 trading below its 200-day moving average, the question on every trader's mind is: should I buy nifty today?

## Stock Market Today
The current market situation is reminiscent of the market crash in October 2008, when the global economy was hit by a financial crisis. Back then, the NIFTY 50 had fallen by over 50% in a matter of months. Although the current situation is different, the fear and uncertainty in the market are similar. For Indian traders, the key implication is to be cautious and not to get caught up in the hype. The NASDAQ forecast is also looking bearish, with the index expected to fall further in the coming days. For global traders, the key takeaway is to keep an eye on the gold price forecast, as it is expected to rise further due to the geopolitical tensions.
