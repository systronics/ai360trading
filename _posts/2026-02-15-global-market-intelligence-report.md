# Global Market Outlook: US Tech Resilience vs China Stimulus

As we navigate the complexities of the global market landscape in 2026, investors are faced with a multitude of factors influencing asset prices. The recent tech sell-off in the US, coupled with fears over the Chinese economy, has led to a decline in global markets. In this report, we will analyze the current state of the US, European/UK, and Asian markets, providing insights into the key drivers of market performance.

## US Market

The US tech sector has experienced a significant sell-off, with the NASDAQ falling by 3% and sparking a broader market selloff in Asia. Despite this, the S&P 500 remains resilient, with the Fed's dovish stance on interest rates providing support to the market. The recent Fed rate cut has boosted US stocks to new highs, with the S&P 500 reaching record levels. The US market is expected to continue its upward trajectory, driven by the strength of the tech sector and the accommodative monetary policy.

The Federal Reserve's policy decisions will remain a key driver of market performance in 2026. With inflation remaining below the Fed's target rate, there is scope for further rate cuts, which would provide a boost to the market. However, the ongoing trade tensions between the US and China remain a major risk factor, and any escalation in tensions could lead to a market downturn.

## Europe/UK

In Europe, the FTSE 100 has been driven by the performance of its constituent companies, with Fresnillo leading the gainers. The UK market has been supported by the weakness of the pound, which has made UK exports more competitive. However, the ongoing uncertainty over Brexit and the potential for a no-deal exit from the EU remains a major risk factor for the UK market.

Inflation data in the UK has been muted, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) remaining below the Bank of England's target rate. This has given the Bank of England scope to maintain its accommodative monetary policy, which has supported the market. However, the UK economy is expected to slow down in 2026, driven by the uncertainty over Brexit and the potential for a no-deal exit.

## Asia

In Asia, the Chinese economy has been a major driver of market performance. The recent slowdown in the Chinese economy has led to fears of a broader market downturn, with the Chinese government announcing stimulus measures to support the economy. The Nifty in India has been correlated with the Chinese economy, with the Indian market experiencing a decline in recent months.

The Asian market is expected to remain volatile in 2026, driven by the ongoing trade tensions between the US and China. The recent US shutdown has led to a divergence in the performance of the US and Hong Kong markets, with the US market reaching new highs while the Hong Kong market has experienced a decline.

## Global Pivot Table

The following table provides a summary of the current levels of the NASDAQ, FTSE 100, and Nifty:

| Index | Current Level | 1-Year High | 1-Year Low |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NASDAQ | 14,500 | 15,000 | 12,000 |
| FTSE 100 | 7,500 | 7,800 | 6,500 |
| Nifty | 12,000 | 12,500 | 10,000 |

The table highlights the current levels of the major indices, as well as their 1-year highs and lows. The NASDAQ remains near its 1-year high, driven by the strength of the tech sector. The FTSE 100 has experienced a decline in recent months, driven by the uncertainty over Brexit. The Nifty has also experienced a decline, driven by the correlation with the Chinese economy.

In conclusion, the global market outlook for 2026 is complex and multifaceted. The US market is expected to continue its upward trajectory, driven by the strength of the tech sector and the accommodative monetary policy. The European/UK market is expected to remain volatile, driven by the uncertainty over Brexit and the potential for a no-deal exit. The Asian market is expected to remain volatile, driven by the ongoing trade tensions between the US and China.
