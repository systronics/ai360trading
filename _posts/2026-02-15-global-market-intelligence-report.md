## Market Intelligence Report for ai360trading.in
The global market landscape is experiencing significant fluctuations, driven by various factors such as the tech sell-off, concerns over the Chinese economy, and uncertainty surrounding tariffs. In this report, we will analyze the performance of the NASDAQ, FTSE 100, and China markets, and provide a 'Global Pivot Table' for traders to make informed decisions.

### NASDAQ Analysis
The NASDAQ has been experiencing a decline, with US tech stocks falling by 3% and sparking a sell-off in Asian markets. According to the Global Economics Intelligence executive summary by McKinsey & Company, the global economy is expected to slow down, which may impact the tech sector. However, the mid-year market outlook 2025 by J.P. Morgan suggests that the tech sector may still experience growth, albeit at a slower pace.

### FTSE 100 Analysis
The FTSE 100 has been performing relatively well, with stocks such as 1Spatial and Fresnillo experiencing significant gains. The biggest UK stock market gainers today include 1Spatial, which jumped 42% on takeover talks, and Fresnillo, which led the FTSE 100 risers. The Morning Wrap by Market Index suggests that the ASX 200 is expected to test record highs, which may have a positive impact on the FTSE 100.

### China Market Analysis
The Chinese economy has been a major concern for investors, with fears of a slowdown impacting global markets. The Global Indices in Focus report by substack.com suggests that the Chinese market has been experiencing a decline, with a Sharpe ratio of -0.5, indicating a high level of volatility. However, the 2026 market outlook by J.P. Morgan suggests that the Chinese market may still experience growth, driven by government stimulus and infrastructure spending.
