The stock market is abuzz with the latest news from China, as the country announces a massive stimulus package worth 1 trillion yuan to rescue its slowing economy. This move has sent ripples across global markets, with investors eagerly watching the developments. But what's behind this stimulus package, and how will it impact the global economy?

### Incident of the Day: China's Stimulus Decision
The Chinese government's decision to inject a massive stimulus package into its economy is a response to the country's slowing growth. The package includes a range of measures, such as funding schemes to support the stock market, plans to boost consumption, and a weaker yuan. But who makes these decisions, and what's the procedure? According to the South China Morning Post, the decision is made by the Chinese State Council, the country's top governing body, in consultation with the People's Bank of China, the central bank.
