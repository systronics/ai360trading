## Market Intelligence Report for ai360trading.in
The first quarter of 2026 has been marked by significant volatility in global markets, influenced by a tech sell-off and concerns over the Chinese economy. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the NASDAQ, FTSE 100, and China markets, along with a comprehensive 'Global Pivot Table' for traders.

### NASDAQ Analysis
The NASDAQ has experienced a decline of 3% in recent times, primarily due to a sell-off in the tech sector. This downturn has had a ripple effect on Asian markets, leading to a broader selloff. Despite this, the US Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates has boosted US stocks, with the NASDAQ reaching new highs. The current trend suggests that the NASDAQ will continue to be influenced by the tech sector's performance and the Fed's monetary policy decisions.

### FTSE 100 Analysis
The FTSE 100 has also been impacted by the global market volatility, with a decline in critical chip stocks such as ASML contributing to the index's fall. However, the FTSE 100 has shown resilience, with stocks like 1Spatial and Fresnillo experiencing significant gains. The FTSE 100's performance is closely tied to the global economy, and traders should keep a close eye on developments in the Chinese economy and the US-China trade negotiations.

### China Markets Analysis
China markets have been influenced by the US market's performance, with a lift in optimism due to new Beijing stimulus measures. The Chinese government's efforts to stimulate economic growth have had a positive impact on the market, and traders should monitor the implementation of these measures closely. The China markets are also closely tied to the global trade landscape, and any developments in the US-China trade negotiations will have a significant impact on the market.
