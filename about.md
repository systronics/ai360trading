## Our Analytical Process
{: .section-title}

To rank at the top of search engines like Google and Bing, our research follows a rigorous three-step verification process designed for serious global investors:

* **Macro Synthesis:** We start with US Federal Reserve policy, inflation trends in the UK, and stimulus data from China to set the global "bias."
* **Sector Rotation:** Our scanners identify which global sectors (Tech, Energy, Finance) are leading the cycle across different time zones.
* **Execution Logic:** We define exact entry, exit, and risk management levels based on the current volatility regime (ATR-adjusted).
